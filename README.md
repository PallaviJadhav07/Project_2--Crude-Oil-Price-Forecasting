Crude Oil Price Forecast

Project Flow

1. Problem Statement

Nowadays, the increased oil prices worldwide are having a great impact on all economic activities. Over the years there has been a fluctuation in petroleum prices, and a close consideration of the demand and supply side effects that sparked these price changes shows there is high probability that these changes will continue in the outlook period and beyond. West African Monetary Agency (2008) concluded that increase in world oil prices have been shown to worsen fiscal deficit positions of oil importing countries like Ghana. For this reason, we believe that if the government can see ahead of monthly petroleum prices, our deficit would not be worsened.
